# Notesapp
Full Stack React Application

# Overview
In this project, we will deploy and host a full stack React application using AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify offers a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with serverless backends. When connected to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the frontend framework and any configured serverless backend resources, and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.
